1). I used quantitative

2). I showed my solution through successful programs, such as programs that had
no errors on the side and inserting comments so that anyone else who was
overlooking the code was able to easily follow along. Because other people are
overlooking my code, variable names matter, they need to be specific, instead of
a plain letter like i or j, it should be something like player_speed. This
allows the person looking at the code to fully understand the code they are
looking at in its entirety. The same thing goes for function names, the functions
shouldn't be something like ball they should be like draw_ball
